# OsrsDropLogger
Used to log drops from mobs in OSRS. Pulls data from the OSRS wiki with pricing for items provided by rsbuddy.

# Usage
Currently you have to build this yourself so clone the repo and build the solution in Visual Studio 2017.  
I am working on creating a nice executable/installer for people to just download instead.

This requires an internet connection to work. It will cache results so it isn't always reaching out to the internet but it does
require the internet in order to do initial data fetching. I can look into offline mode functionality but seeing as you need the internet
to play OSRS it will be near the bottom of my queue.

I want to make this a fully featured companion desktop app for OSRS and if enough people want it, I will look into making it into
a mobile app.
